# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

The benefits of SPAs versus MPAs is that they can be faster and more responsive since only neccesary parts of the site will be re-rendered oppose to full page reloads for navigation. You can also maintain the state of your site more easily since there doesn't need to be a full reload to navigate throughout the page.
