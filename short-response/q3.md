# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer
It is appropriate to use the '*" path for a route in React Router to catch any unmatched `<route>`s. This is typically used in a fallback component that will render when the user tries to navigate to a URL path with no matching `<route>`. '*' acts as a 'last resort' that will match to any path that doesn't already have a predefined matching route.
