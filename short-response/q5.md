# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
The following paths that will match the `/products/:id` path are going to be the second and third option. These paths work as `apple` and `5` serve as the dynamic `id` value in the URL. Although `apple` is not a number, it can still be intepreted as an `id` since there is nothing saying that `id` must be a number. The first option doesn't match because there is no additional segement after `/products` to be considered the `id` that `/products/:id` is looking to replace. The last option will not match because the path `/products/:id` is expecting for the URL path stop after the `id` segment, whereas this path goes beyond and has an additional segment.
